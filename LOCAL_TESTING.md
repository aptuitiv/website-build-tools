# Testing while developing local

## Testing locally with another project

In the `website-build-scripts` library path use `npm link` to add the project to the local npm registry.

```bash
cd ./route-to-library
npm link
```

In the project's folder that you want to use this library, use `npm link @aptuitiv/website-build-scripts` to install the package locally.

If you need to update the rets-client library do the following.

### Unlink the project

You should unlink the local project for any of these situations:

- You are switching branches.
- You are adding or removing node modules in this project. (This doesn't apply if you're adding or removing node modules in the project that uses this library.)
- You want to use the live version of this package from NPM.

First, in the project that uses this library:

```bash
npm unlink @aptuitiv/website-build-scripts --no-**save**
```

The `--no-save` flag keeps the original live version of this package from NPM.

Then, in this package:

```bash
npm unlink
```
