# Copy file actions

Often you'll need to copy files from the `node_modules` folder to your build folder to deploy to your website. The easiest way to do this is to set up your own configuration file and set the `copy` value.

Here is an example of a JSON configuration file with the `copy` configuration.

```json
{
  "copy": [
    {
      "src": [
        "node_modules/@splidejs/splide/dist/css/splide.min.css",
        "node_modules/@splidejs/splide/dist/js/splide.min.js",
        "node_modules/@splidejs/splide-extension-video/dist/js/splide-extension-video.min.js",
        "node_modules/@splidejs/splide-extension-video/dist/css/splide-extension-video.min.css"
      ],
      "dest": "splide"
    },
    {
      "src": "node_modules/just-validate/dist/just-validate.production.min.js",
      "dest": "just-validate"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each object in the `copy` array should have a `src` value and a `dest` value.

The `src` value can be a string matching a single file, a string glob, and array of of files, or an array of globs.

The `dest` value is the folder within the theme build folder to copy the files to.

The command line call to copy files is:

```bash
aptuitiv-build copy
```

The copy `src` paths will be watched and re-copied if they change while the [watch](watch) process is running.
