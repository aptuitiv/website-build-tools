# Icon action

The icon action will combine all SVG icons into a sprite file. The file will be a Twig template in the snippets folder. By default it's called `svg-icons.twig`.

## Process all icons

This will process all the icons in the [`icons` configuration](../configuration/icons).

```bash
aptuitiv-build icon-sprite
aptuitiv-build icons
```

## Process a specific icon folder

Specify a specific icon folder to process with the `path` parameter and the file to save it to with the `output` parameter.

```bash
aptuitiv-build icons -path weather-icons -output snippets/weather-icons.twig
aptuitiv-build icons -p weather-icons -o snippets/weather-icons.twig
```

You can leave off the `.twig` value from the `output` parameter, but for clarity we recommend keeping it.

```bash
aptuitiv-build icons -path weather-icons -output snippets/weather-icons.twig
```

same as:

```bash
aptuitiv-build icons -path weather-icons -output snippets/weather-icons
```

If the `path` value is already in your [`icons` configuration](../configuration/icons) then you can pass just the `path` value and the `output` path will come from the icon configuration `build` value.

```bash
aptuitiv-build icons -path weather-icons
aptuitiv-build icons -p weather-icons
```
