# Initialize action

If you are creating a site from scratch or you are starting out with an existing website, you can run the `init` command to set up the environment.

This will do a few things things:

1. Check to make sure that the `.env` and the configuration file are in place.
2. Create the `.env` file with the FTP credentials if the file doesn't exist.
3. Create the configuration file if it doesn't exist.
4. Optionally install an Aptuitiv theme.
5. Optionally set up a new basic website.
6. Run the [build](./build) process to build the site.

If the `.env` file needs to be created then follow the prompts.

The following are equivalent:

```bash
aptuitiv-build init
aptuitiv-build initialize
```

## Options

The following options are available:

- `--config` or `-c`: Specify a different name for the configuration file.
- `--name` or `n`: Specify the name of the project.
- `--no-build`: Don't build the files after the initialization.
- `--type` or `-t`: Specify the type of project to create. See the [Type of project](#type-of-project) section below.

## Prompts

### Project name

You will be prompted for the project name if one of the following conditions is met:

- The folder you're running this in is blank.
- The `.env` file doesn't exist.
- The `package.json` file doesn't exist.
- You didn't pass the project name as an argument with `--name` or `-n`.

The prompt will default to using the current folder name converted to title case. (For example, converting "my-project" to "My Project".)

This value will be used for the `name` value in the `project.json` file if necessary and for the `.env` file.

### Type of project

You'll be prompted to choose what type of project you're initializing.

- **Existing website with project files**: Use this when you're starting to work on an existing website, the folder has all the project files, and you just need to set up the `.env` file and do the initial build.
- **New basic website**: Use this if you're starting a brand new project that isn't using one of the Aptuitiv themes and the folder is empty.
- **Carmine theme**: Use this if you're starting a new project using the Aptuitiv Carmine theme.
- **Harvest theme**: Use this if you're starting a new project using the Aptuitiv Harvest theme.
- **Mallard theme**: Use this if you're starting a new project using the Aptuitiv Mallard theme.
- **Rivera theme**: Use this if you're starting a new project using the Aptuitiv Rivera theme.
- **Skeleton theme**: Use this if you're starting a new project using the Aptuitiv Skeleton theme.

If you want to pass the type of project as an argument you can use the `--type` or `-t` option. Below are the values you can use:

| Type of project | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| Existing website with project files | existing |
| New website | basic |
| Carmine theme | theme-carmine |
| Harvest theme | theme-harvest |
| Mallard theme | theme-mallard |
| Rivera theme | theme-rivera |
| Skeleton theme | theme-skeleton |

For example, to set up a site with the Carmine theme you can run:

```bash
aptuitiv-build init --type theme-carmine
```

### Package.json data

If the `package.json` file doesn't exist and you're not setting up a theme website then you'll get the following prompts:

- Who is the package author name? (defaults to "Aptuitiv, Inc")
- What is the package author email? (defaults to "hello@aptuitiv.com")

You can typically stick with the defaults.

## Configuration file

By default the configuration file built will be `.aptuitiv-buildrc.js`. You can specify a different name if you prefer. See the [Configuration](/configuration/) page for valid file names.

The following are equivalent:

```bash
aptuitiv-build init --config .aptuitiv-buildrc.cjs
aptuitiv-build init -c .aptuitiv-buildrc.cjs
```

## Don't build the files

You can disable building the files with the `--no-build` options.

```bash
aptuitiv-build init --no-build
```
