# Theme configuration actions

## Format the theme configuration files

This affects the  `theme-settings.json` and `theme-styles.json` files. The following actions will be performed:
- Validate the theme configuration files to ensure they are valid.
- Reorder the top level groups in the theme configuration files to be in alphabetical order. Sub groups and sections will be in the order that they are defined in the file.
- Reorder the properties for fields so that the properties show as:
    - name
    - label
    - type
    - description
    - Any other properties in the order that they already are in the object.
- Format the JSON to make them easier to read.

```bash
aptuitiv-build format-theme-json
```

If you want to format a single file, you can do so by passing the file name as an argument.

```bash
aptuitiv-build format-theme-json -f theme-settings.json
aptuitiv-build format-theme-json --file theme-settings.json
```

## Pull theme configuration files

Copy the theme configuration files from the build folder to the source folder. This is typically done after downloading the theme configuration files via FTP.

```bash
aptuitiv-build pull-theme-config
```

## Push theme configuration files

Copy the theme configuration files from the source folder to the build folder.

```bash
aptuitiv-build push-theme-config
```
