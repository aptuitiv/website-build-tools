title: Convert Gulp

# Convert gulp action

This command is useful to convert the legacy Gulp build process to use these build tools.

This will do a few things things:

1. Remove legacy build files that aren't needed anymore.
2. Parse the `gulp/config.js` file and extract the `copy` and `scripts` configuration. That will be used to create the build tool configuration file.
3. Create the build tool configuration file.
4. Check to make sure that the `.env` and the configuration file are in place.
5. Create the `.env` file with the FTP credentials if the file doesn't exist.

To use this command first install the build tools.

```bash
npm i - D @aptuitiv/website-build-tools
```

Then run the following command on the command line:

```bash
aptuitiv-build gulp-convert
```

By default the configuration file built will be `.aptuitiv-buildrc.js`. You can specify a different name if you prefer. See the [Configuration](/configuration/) page for valid file names.

The following are equivalent:

```bash
aptuitiv-build gulp-convert --config .aptuitiv-buildrc.cjs
aptuitiv-build gulp-convert -c .aptuitiv-buildrc.cjs
```

If the `.env` file needs to be created then follow the prompts.
