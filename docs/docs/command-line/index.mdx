title: Command Line Usage

# Command line usage

The way that you interact with the build tools is through the command line. Even if you've set up `scripts` in your `package.json` file those script commands call the build tool actions through a command line call.

The pattern for a command line call is:

```bash
aptuitiv-build <action> [parameters]
```

## Getting help

You can get help by using `--help` or calling `help`.

```bash
aptuitiv-build --help
```

or

```bash
aptuitiv-build help
```

You can also use `--help` with any of the actions to get help with them.

```bash
aptuitiv-build css --help
```

## Changing the root directory

If you're not calling the script from the base directory of your project then you must pass the `--root` argument so that the correct folders paths are used.

```bash
aptuitiv-build pull-template --root path/to/my/project/root
```

Or you can do a relative path to the root from the current directory.

```bash
aptuitiv-build pull-template --root ../../
```
