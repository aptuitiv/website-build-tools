# Package.json action

You can do some processing on the `package.json` file in the website project.

## Format the `package.json` file

This will reorder the contents, set the correct license, update the scripts, and dev dependencies.

This can be used when setting up a new site or converting a gulp-build process to use this package.

```bash
aptuitiv-build package-json format
```

## Update the `scripts` in the `package.json` file

This will update the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file to use the [latest recommended ones](/configuration/package-json-scripts).

```bash
aptuitiv-build package-json scripts
```
