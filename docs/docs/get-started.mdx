# Getting Started

The Aptuitiv Website Build Tools are a set of NPM scripts that are used to build websites with [Aptuitiv CMS](https://aptuitiv.com). It is an opinionated set of tools that follows the
website development philosophy at [Aptuitiv](https://aptuitiv.com).

The first step is to install the build tools in your project.

## Installation

Install in your project:

```bash
npm install @aptuitiv/website-build-tools
```

While you can use this in individual projects, we recommend that you install it globally so that you can use the `aptuitiv-build` commands to help initialize, update, and build your project.

```bash
npm install -g @aptuitiv/website-build-tools
```
